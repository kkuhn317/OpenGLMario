# How to Build
You need a Windows computer and Visual Studio 2022. I have moved all the dependencies to be part of the project itself (in the includes and lib folders), so I hope that you will not need anything more than that. Just open the project in Visual Studio and click the run button to build the game.

# How to Play
Mario is on the left and Luigi is on the right. To move Mario, use the A and D keys to walk left and right. Use the W key to jump and use the S key to shoot a fireball. To move Luigi, press the left and right arrow keys to walk left and right. Use the up-arrow key to jump, and the down arrow key to shoot a fireball. If a player gets hit by a fireball, they lose some health, as indicated by their health bar. Once all a playerâ€™s health is gone, the other player will win. Press the space key to restart after someone wins.
